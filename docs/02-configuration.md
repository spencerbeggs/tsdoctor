# Configuration

Every option the plugin accepts, organized by where it lives. You configure the plugin through a single options object passed to `ApiExtractorPlugin(...)`. At the top level you pick single-API mode (`api`) or multi-API mode (`apis`), then layer on categories, source links, theme, performance and LLMs settings.

## Top-level options

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  api: { /* single-API config */ },
  apis: [ /* multi-API config[] */ ],
  ogImage: "./assets/og-default.png",
  defaultCategories: { /* category overrides applied to every API */ },
  errors: { example: "show" },
  llmsPlugin: { scopes: true },
  observability: { logLevel: "info" },
});
```

| Option | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api` | single-API config or `null` | Document one package. Mutually exclusive with a non-empty `apis`. `null` makes the plugin inert. |
| `apis` | multi-API config array or `null` | Document several packages in one portal. `null` or `[]` makes the plugin inert. |
| `ogImage` | string or object | Default Open Graph image for generated pages. Requires RSPress's `siteOrigin` (see below). |
| `defaultCategories` | category record | Override the built-in categories for every API. |
| `errors` | object | `{ example: "show" \| "suppress" }` controls whether code-example type errors surface. |
| `llmsPlugin` | boolean or object | Enable and configure per-package `llms*.txt` generation. |
| `observability` | object | Log level, opt-in JSONL trace, and slow-operation thresholds. |
| `logLevel` | string | Deprecated alias for `observability.logLevel`. |
| `performance` | object | Deprecated alias for `observability.thresholds`. |

Provide at most one non-empty option between `api` and `apis`. Use `api` for a single package — it also supports RSPress multiVersion through `versions` — and `apis` for a portal that hosts more than one package. To keep the plugin wired up without documenting anything yet, pass an empty value for either key; see [inert configuration](#inert-configuration).

## Inert configuration

Sometimes the plugin has to be in `rspress.config.ts` before there is anything to document: a docs site that ships ahead of its first release, or a config that discovers packages on disk and finds none yet. Passing an empty value for `api` or `apis` makes the plugin a no-op. `api: null`, `apis: null` and `apis: []` all validate the rest of your options and then generate nothing — no pages, no snapshot database, no `llms*.txt` post-processing and no LLMs UI wiring. The rest of your options stay in place, so filling in a model later is a one-line change.

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  apis: [],
  llmsPlugin: { scopes: true },
});
// Options are validated; the build produces no API pages.
```

The plugin stays wired into RSPress either way. A `with-api` code block in one of your own guides still renders with syntax highlighting; it just loses the Twoslash type-checking and hover tooltips that a loaded model supplies, and picks them up once you fill one in.

The empty value must be explicit — that is what separates a deliberate no-op from a misconfiguration. Omitting both keys still fails validation with `Must provide either 'api' or 'apis'.` An empty sibling is fine: `{ api: cfg, apis: [] }` is valid and documents `cfg`, because only a non-empty `apis` conflicts with `api`. Earlier releases rejected `apis: []`; it is now an accepted no-op.

## Single-API config (`api`)

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  api: {
    packageName: "my-library",
    name: "My Library",
    model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
    packageJson: "./api/package.json",
    tsconfig: "./api/tsconfig.json",
    baseRoute: "/reference",
    apiFolder: "api",
    theme: { light: "github-light-default", dark: "github-dark-default" },
  },
});
```

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `packageName` | string | required | npm name of the documented package. |
| `name` | string | `packageName` | Display name used in titles and navigation. |
| `model` | path, URL or loader fn | required unless `versions` is set | The `.api.json` model. |
| `packageJson` | path, URL or loader fn | — | The package's `package.json` for version and dependency detection. |
| `baseRoute` | string | — | Route prefix for all pages of this API. |
| `apiFolder` | string or `null` | `"api"` | Folder segment to nest pages under. Set to `null` to write categories at the route root. |
| `versions` | record | — | Per-version models for RSPress multiVersion. See the versioned recipe. |
| `theme` | string or `{ light, dark }` | — | Shiki theme for code blocks. |
| `categories` | category record | built-in defaults | Override how API items are grouped. |
| `source` | `{ url, ref? }` | — | Base URL for "view source" links. |
| `externalPackages` | spec array | — | External packages to load types for, used by hover tooltips. |
| `autoDetectDependencies` | object | peer + auto on | Auto-load types from the package's own dependencies. |
| `ogImage` | string or object | inherits top-level | Open Graph image for this API's pages. |
| `llmsPlugin` | boolean or object | inherits top-level | LLMs settings for this API. |
| `tsconfig` | path, URL or loader fn | — | `tsconfig.json` used when type-checking code examples. |
| `compilerOptions` | object | — | Inline compiler options, merged over `tsconfig`. |

`model` (and `packageJson`, `tsconfig`) take a string path, a `URL` or an async loader function that returns the content, so you can fetch a model over the network or generate one on the fly.

With neither `tsconfig` nor `compilerOptions` set, the examples are still type-checked, under the plugin's defaults: ESNext target and module, bundler resolution, non-strict, `lib: ["ESNext", "DOM"]`. `compilerOptions` and a discovered `tsconfig.json` merge over those defaults one option at a time, but an option holding an array replaces the default array outright rather than adding to it — a config declaring `lib: ["esnext"]` drops the DOM globals, so list every lib your examples need.

## Multi-API config (`apis`)

Each entry in `apis` has the same shape as the single-API config, with two differences. `model` is required, because multi-API mode has no `versions` field, and each entry defaults to its own `/{packageName}/api` route so the packages do not collide — set `baseRoute` per entry only to override that default. See the [multi-package recipe](./05-multi-package.md).

Each entry's `tsconfig` and `compilerOptions` type-check that package's own code examples, including a `with-api` fence in that package's docs; a neighboring entry's config never applies. `compilerOptions` merges over the defaults rather than replacing them, so setting one option on an entry changes only that option for that entry. Entries that declare the same configuration share a single TypeScript environment, so agreeing on a shared `tsconfig` across entries costs nothing extra. Only the compiler configuration is scoped per API — the declaration files for every documented package still live in one combined virtual file system, so a type owned by one package resolves correctly when another package's example references it.

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  apis: [
    {
      packageName: "core",
      model: "./api/core.api.json",
      packageJson: "./api/core-package.json",
    },
    {
      packageName: "utils",
      baseRoute: "/utils",
      model: "./api/utils.api.json",
    },
  ],
});
```

## Categories

Categories control how API items are grouped into folders and labeled in the sidebar. The built-in categories cover the seven API item kinds, and the plugin exports them as `DEFAULT_CATEGORIES`:

```ts
import { DEFAULT_CATEGORIES } from "rspress-plugin-api-extractor";

console.log(Object.keys(DEFAULT_CATEGORIES));
// ["classes", "interfaces", "functions", "types", "enums", "variables", "namespaces"]
```

Each category is an object:

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `displayName` | string | required | Plural label shown as the sidebar group heading. |
| `singularName` | string | required | Singular label used in page titles. |
| `folderName` | string | required | URL/folder segment for items in this category. |
| `itemKinds` | API item kind array | — | Which API Extractor item kinds belong here. |
| `tsdocModifier` | string | — | Route items carrying a given TSDoc modifier into this category. |
| `collapsible` | boolean | `true` | Whether the sidebar group can collapse. |
| `collapsed` | boolean | `true` | Whether the group starts collapsed. |
| `overviewHeaders` | number array | `[2]` | Heading levels surfaced in the overview. |

To override a single category, spread the defaults and replace what you want. Set it on `defaultCategories`, which applies to every API, or on a specific API's `categories`:

```ts
import { ApiExtractorPlugin, DEFAULT_CATEGORIES } from "rspress-plugin-api-extractor";

ApiExtractorPlugin({
  api: {
    packageName: "my-library",
    model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
    categories: {
      ...DEFAULT_CATEGORIES,
      classes: {
        ...DEFAULT_CATEGORIES.classes,
        displayName: "Components",
        collapsed: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Source links

Set `source` to turn API items into "view source" links pointing at your repository:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
  source: {
    url: "https://github.com/me/my-library",
    ref: "main",
  },
}
```

`url` is the repository base. `ref` is the branch, tag or commit to link against; omit it to use the repository default.

## Theme

`theme` sets the Shiki syntax-highlighting theme for code blocks. Pass a single theme name for both light and dark, or an object with separate themes:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
  theme: {
    light: "github-light-default",
    dark: "github-dark-default",
  },
}
```

Any [Shiki bundled theme](https://shiki.style/themes) name works.

## External package types and auto-detection

Interactive code examples are type-checked, so types referenced from other packages — `ZodType` from `zod`, say — need to be loaded. By default the plugin finds these in your package's dependencies. Control that with `autoDetectDependencies`:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
  packageJson: "./api/package.json",
  autoDetectDependencies: {
    peerDependencies: true,
    autoDependencies: true,
    dependencies: false,
    devDependencies: false,
  },
}
```

| Field | Default | Loads types from |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `peerDependencies` | `true` | The package's peer dependencies. |
| `autoDependencies` | `true` | Dependencies the plugin infers are referenced by the public API. |
| `dependencies` | `false` | All runtime dependencies. |
| `devDependencies` | `false` | All dev dependencies. |

To load a package's types explicitly, list it in `externalPackages`:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: "./api/my-library.api.json",
  externalPackages: [
    { name: "zod", version: "^3.22.4" },
    { name: "effect", version: "^3.0.0" },
  ],
}
```

Each spec takes `name` and `version`, plus an optional `tsconfig` and `compilerOptions` that control how that package's types load.

## Twoslash result cache

Type-checking code examples is by far the most expensive part of generating a page, so Twoslash results are cached between builds automatically — there is nothing to configure. The cache lives in your machine's XDG cache directory (`~/.cache/tsdoctor/twoslash.sqlite`), not in the repository or your `outDir`, so there is nothing to commit or gitignore.

Each entry is keyed on the code, the compiler options, the declarations for the API it belongs to and the TypeScript version that checked them, so a cached result is never served under a compiler or configuration that would produce a different answer — upgrading TypeScript starts a fresh generation even when your declarations have not changed. That safety comes with coarse invalidation: any change to a documented API's types starts a fresh generation for that API, but an unchanged API's cache stays warm across CI reruns, prose-only edits and config or theme changes. The build summary reports the hit rate:

```text
Twoslash cache: 14/14 hits (100%), 14 entries
```

An unreadable or missing cache degrades to a full type-check rather than failing the build. See [Troubleshooting](./11-troubleshooting.md#twoslash-cache-shows-0-hits-even-though-nothing-changed) if the reported hit rate looks wrong when you are benchmarking build times.

## Open Graph images

Open Graph tags need an absolute URL, and that comes from RSPress rather than from this plugin. Set [`siteOrigin`](https://rspress.rs/api/config/config-basic#siteorigin) in `rspress.config.ts`; the plugin joins it with `base` exactly as RSPress does (`siteOrigin + base + routePath`):

```ts title="rspress.config.ts"
export default defineConfig({
  siteOrigin: "https://docs.example.com",
  base: "/",
});
```

Without `siteOrigin`, the tags are still emitted but their URLs stay **root-relative** (`/api/class/foo`), matching RSPress's own documented `base + routePath` fallback. That keeps them inspectable under `rspress dev` on localhost, where no configured origin could be correct. Set `siteOrigin` for production, where absolute URLs are what crawlers need.

There is deliberately no plugin-level override for the origin: a second answer could disagree with the site's own and silently advertise a host the site is not served from.

`ogImage` accepts a string path/URL or a metadata object. Set it at the top level as a site-wide default, or per-API to override:

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  ogImage: {
    url: "https://docs.example.com/og.png",
    width: 1200,
    height: 630,
    alt: "My Library API",
  },
  api: { packageName: "my-library", model: "./api/my-library.api.json" },
});
```

| Field | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | string | Image URL (required when using the object form). |
| `secureUrl` | string | HTTPS variant of the URL. |
| `type` | string | MIME type, for example `image/png`. |
| `width` / `height` | number | Image dimensions in pixels. |
| `alt` | string | Alt text. |

## Observability

`observability` controls build-output verbosity, the opt-in JSONL trace
artifact, and slow-operation thresholds:

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  api: { packageName: "my-library", model: "./api/my-library.api.json" },
  observability: {
    logLevel: "info",
    trace: true,           // or a file path string
    thresholds: {
      slowCodeBlock: 100,
      slowPageGeneration: 500,
      slowApiLoad: 1000,
    },
  },
});
```

### `logLevel`

Controls which events appear in the console:

| Level | What you see |
| ----- | ------------ |
| `none` | Nothing. |
| `error` | Fatal errors only. |
| `warn` | Recoverable errors and warnings. |
| `info` | Per-file and phase milestones (the usual choice). |
| `debug` | All events in structured JSON. Activates JSON output mode. |
| `trace` | Everything, including fine-grained internals (VFS keys, compiler options). |

`verbose` is accepted as a synonym for `debug`.

The `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable overrides the configured level for a
single run, taking the same values as the `logLevel` field.

### `trace`

Set to `true` to write a full-fidelity JSONL log of every event to a
temporary file, or pass a file path string to control where it lands.

The trace artifact captures **every** event regardless of `logLevel` — running
at `logLevel: "info"` with `trace: true` still records all events to the file.
This is useful for post-build analysis or reproducing Twoslash diagnostics
(the `TwoslashCheckFailed` event records the VFS key list and compiler options).

### `thresholds`

Durations (in milliseconds) for slow-operation warnings:

| Field | Default | Triggered by |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| `slowCodeBlock` | `100` | A single code block taking longer than this. |
| `slowPageGeneration` | `500` | A page generation phase exceeding this. |
| `slowApiLoad` | `1000` | Model loading or config resolution exceeding this. |
| `slowFileOperation` | `50` | A file write exceeding this. |
| `slowDbOperation` | `100` | A snapshot-store operation exceeding this. |

## Performance (deprecated)

`performance` is a deprecated alias for `observability.thresholds`. Use
`observability.thresholds` instead. When both are set, `observability` wins.

## LLMs

`llmsPlugin` turns on per-package `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `llms-docs.txt` and `llms-api.txt` files, plus the in-page actions that copy or open them. Pass `true` for defaults or an object to configure. The [LLMs guide](./09-llms.md) has the full picture, including the RSPress `llms: true` prerequisite.

```ts
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  api: { packageName: "my-library", model: "./api/my-library.api.json" },
  llmsPlugin: {
    scopes: true,
    apiTxt: true,
    copyButtonText: "Copy Markdown",
    viewOptions: ["markdownLink", "chatgpt", "claude"],
  },
});
```

| Field | Type | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Turn the integration on or off. |
| `scopes` | boolean | `true` | Generate per-package files and scoped UI actions. |
| `apiTxt` | boolean | `true` | Generate `llms-api.txt` (API-only content). |
| `showCopyButton` | boolean | `true` | Show the copy button in the page UI. |
| `showViewOptions` | boolean | `true` | Show the view-options dropdown. |
| `copyButtonText` | string | `"Copy Markdown"` | Copy button label. |
| `viewOptions` | string array | `["markdownLink", "chatgpt", "claude"]` | Dropdown actions. |

## Logging (deprecated)

`logLevel` is a deprecated top-level alias for `observability.logLevel`. Use
`observability.logLevel` instead. When both are set, `observability` wins.

```ts
// Old form — still works, but prefer observability.logLevel
ApiExtractorPlugin({
  logLevel: "info",
  api: { packageName: "my-library", model: "./api/my-library.api.json" },
});
```
