# Single package

The single-package recipe documents one library. It uses the `api` block and is where most projects start. This guide builds on [Getting started](./01-getting-started.md) with the full set of placement and presentation options.

## Baseline

```ts
import path, { dirname } from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";
import { defineConfig } from "@rspress/core";
import { ApiExtractorPlugin } from "rspress-plugin-api-extractor";

const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));

export default defineConfig({
  root: "docs",
  title: "My Library",
  outDir: "dist",
  plugins: [
    ApiExtractorPlugin({
      observability: { logLevel: "info" },
      api: {
        name: "My Library",
        packageName: "my-library",
        model: path.join(__dirname, "api/my-library.api.json"),
        packageJson: path.join(__dirname, "api/package.json"),
        tsconfig: path.join(__dirname, "api/tsconfig.json"),
        apiFolder: "api",
        theme: {
          light: "github-light-default",
          dark: "github-dark-default",
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
  route: { cleanUrls: true },
});
```

This mirrors the `basic` example site. It documents one package called `my-library`, nests every page under an `api/` folder and sets the GitHub light/dark Shiki themes.

## Choosing where pages land

Two fields decide the routes:

- `apiFolder` nests pages under a single folder segment. With `apiFolder: "api"`, a class page lands at `/api/class/myclass`. Set it to `null` (or omit it) to write categories at the root: `/class/myclass`.
- `baseRoute` prefixes the entire API. With `baseRoute: "/reference"` and `apiFolder: "api"`, the class lands at `/reference/api/class/myclass`.

Pick whichever keeps your generated API pages out of the way of your hand-written guides. A common layout is hand-written pages at the root and generated reference under `apiFolder: "api"`.

## Display name

`packageName` is the npm name and supplies the import lines in code examples. `name` is the label readers see in page titles and the sidebar. Omit `name` and the package name is used as-is. Set it when the npm name is not what you want on the page:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "@acme/widget-kit",
  name: "Widget Kit",
  model: path.join(__dirname, "api/widget-kit.api.json"),
}
```

## Adding source links

Point `source` at your repository to turn each documented item into a "view source" link:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: path.join(__dirname, "api/my-library.api.json"),
  source: {
    url: "https://github.com/me/my-library",
    ref: "main",
  },
}
```

## Type-checked examples

Code examples in both the generated pages and your own guides are type-checked and gain hover tooltips. Supply `tsconfig` (and `packageJson`) to check them under your package's own compiler configuration; without it they are checked under the plugin's defaults, which is usually close enough for examples. The plugin loads the documented package's own types from the model and pulls in dependency types on its own. If an example references a type from another package that auto-detection misses, add it to `externalPackages`:

```ts
api: {
  packageName: "my-library",
  model: path.join(__dirname, "api/my-library.api.json"),
  packageJson: path.join(__dirname, "api/package.json"),
  tsconfig: path.join(__dirname, "api/tsconfig.json"),
  externalPackages: [{ name: "zod", version: "^3.22.4" }],
}
```

## Build and preview

```bash
npx rspress dev
# Generates pages and serves them with hot reload at http://localhost:3000

npx rspress build
# Writes the static site to outDir (dist/ here)
```

The first build generates every page; later builds only rewrite pages whose content changed.

If you would rather drive the server from a script — to free a stale port and open the browser at a specific page once the server is ready — the package exports a `serve` helper:

```ts
// scripts/dev.mts
import { serve } from "rspress-plugin-api-extractor";

await serve({ mode: "dev", openPath: "/api/" });
// Frees the port, runs `rspress dev`, opens http://localhost:4173/api/ when ready
```

`serve` accepts `mode` (`"dev"` or `"preview"`), `port`, `open`, `openPath`, `packageManager`, `cwd` and a `readyWhen` predicate; all are optional. It defaults to `pnpm rspress dev` on port `4173` and skips opening a browser when `NO_OPEN` is set.

## Next steps

- [Versioned](./06-versioned.md) — keep this single package and add RSPress multiVersion.
- [i18n](./07-i18n.md) — add translated documentation.
- [Runtime components](./10-runtime-components.md) — embed live, type-checked examples in your own guides.
