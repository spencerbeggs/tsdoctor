# Multi-Entry VFS Generation

## Overview

To give Twoslash a TypeScript project it can type-check against, the plugin reconstructs `.d.ts` files from the API Extractor model and writes them into a virtual file system under `node_modules/<package>/`. Each entry point gets its own declaration file, and the synthetic `package.json` exposes those files via either a `types` field (single entry) or an `exports` map (multiple entries) so TypeScript resolves cross-entry references the way the real package would.

For deduplication and route-collision handling in the documentation pipeline, see `multi-entry-resolution.md`.

## ApiExtractedPackage

`ApiExtractedPackage` (`packages/model/src/ApiExtractedPackage.ts`, moved there from the adapter in the Tier 1 core moves) extends `VirtualPackage` from `@tsdoctor/vfs` ("v2" below refers to the `type-registry-effect@2` line this class came from, whose semantics carry into `@tsdoctor/vfs` unchanged). It overrides declaration generation to emit high-fidelity `.d.ts` output from an `ApiPackage` — enum values, full JSDoc, namespace members and all interface member kinds — while delegating the VFS map and `package.json` synthesis to the base class.

`VirtualPackage` moved from `@tsdoctor/registry` to `@tsdoctor/vfs` in the Tier 1 core moves; it had no consumers inside the registry, and both the registry and `@tsdoctor/model` need it. In v2, `VirtualPackage` is a **Schema class exported directly** (there is no enclosing namespace, so it is imported as `import { VirtualPackage } from "@tsdoctor/vfs"`). Its constructor takes a single props object — `super({ name, version, entries })` — and validates at construction time, which means the entries map must be complete before `super` runs.

Factory methods:

- `ApiExtractedPackage.fromApiModel(modelPath)` — load an `.api.json` file and build the package.
- `ApiExtractedPackage.fromPackage(apiPackage, packageName)` — build from an in-memory `ApiPackage`.

`fromPackage` walks the package's entry points, derives each entry's file name (`index.d.ts` for the main entry, `<name>.d.ts` for named entries) and calls `generateDeclarations(entryPoint)` for each. Because declaration generation is an instance method but the instance cannot be constructed without its entries, `fromPackage` uses a **scratch-instance pattern**: it constructs a throwaway `ApiExtractedPackage` with a placeholder entries map (`[["index.d.ts", ""]]`), uses that scratch instance's `getEntryPointName` / `generateDeclarations` to build the real entries map, then constructs the returned instance from it. This replaces the v1 trick of constructing with an empty map and mutating it afterwards, which the v2 Schema validation forbids.

The `generateVfs()` wrapper that used to shadow `toVfs()` under the v1 name is **deleted**; callers use `toVfs()` directly.

### Excerpt rendering and reference fidelity

Declaration excerpts are rendered through a private `renderExcerpt` (token-by-token) rather than read as raw `excerpt.text`, which repairs two fidelity hazards in the API Extractor model that otherwise emit false Twoslash errors. All excerpt reads route through it — extends/implements, type aliases, variables, functions, members and type-parameter constraints/defaults.

- **Abstract modifier** — `abstract` is propagated onto reconstructed class headers (and through the namespace-nested class path that strips `declare`). The class body keeps abstract members, so dropping the modifier on the header produces `TS1244`/`TS1253` ("abstract member in a non-abstract class") in the VFS `.d.ts`.
- **dts-rollup `$N` alias normalization** — `normalizeTokenText` strips dts-rollup disambiguation suffixes from reference tokens. The rollup renames a re-imported symbol as `Name$1` while its canonical reference stays the un-suffixed `Name`; because the import prepender (see `import-generation-system.md`) imports the canonical name, emitting the suffixed text would leave `Name$1` undefined (`TS2304`). The suffix is stripped only when the de-suffixed text matches the token's canonical symbol (or its leaf), so identifiers that genuinely end in `$N` are untouched.

`ApiExtractedPackage` keeps its OWN private `extractPlainText` and does NOT use the `@tsdoctor/model` prose extraction. The two look similar but are different algorithms: this one PRESERVES `{@link X.Y}` TSDoc syntax and reconstructs fenced code blocks (needed for faithful `.d.ts`/JSDoc reconstruction), whereas the library's prose extraction flattens `{@link}` to display text and drops code fences. They are not interchangeable. How the rest of the plugin consumes the model package directly is summarized in `build-architecture.md` ("Core Package Consumption").

## VFS layout

`VirtualPackage.toVfs()` returns a `Vfs` (a `Map<string, string>`) prefixed with `node_modules/<package>/`:

```text
Single entry point:
node_modules/my-package/
  ├── index.d.ts          (all declarations)
  └── package.json        { "types": "index.d.ts" }

Multiple entry points:
node_modules/my-package/
  ├── index.d.ts          (main entry declarations)
  ├── testing.d.ts        (testing entry declarations)
  └── package.json        { "exports": {
       ".":        { "types": "./index.d.ts" },
       "./testing": { "types": "./testing.d.ts" } } }
```

The `types`-vs-`exports` decision lives in `VirtualPackage.toPackageJson()` in `@tsdoctor/vfs` (since v2; v1 called it `generatePackageJson()`), driven by how many entries the package has, and is invoked from `toVfs()`. `ApiExtractedPackage` only supplies the entries map; it does not build `package.json` itself. v2 also throws on two structural errors the plugin must avoid: declaring `package.json` as an entry, and two entry file names that normalize to the same export key.

## Import prepending

`toVfs()` emits declarations only. External type references (e.g. `ZodType` from `zod`) still need `import type` statements, which are prepended afterward by `prependImportsToVfs` in `layers/config-resolution.ts`. See `import-generation-system.md`.

## Backward compatibility

Single-entry packages are detected automatically (`entries.size === 1`) and use the simple `types` field, so the VFS works with every TypeScript module resolution strategy. Multi-entry packages use `exports`, and cross-entry references (a `testing.d.ts` type referencing a `Plugin` declared in `index.d.ts`) resolve through TypeScript's own module resolution against the synthetic `package.json`.

## Known limitations

- **Exports complexity** — the synthetic `package.json` only emits the simple `{ "types": "…" }` form, not conditional exports.
- **Subpath nesting** — nested entry names like `./utils/helpers` are carried through as file names but not specially flattened.
